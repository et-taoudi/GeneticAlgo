# Genetic Algorithm
## Genetic Algorithm Structure
A Genetic Algorithm is an evolutive process that maintains a population of chromosomes (potential solutions). Each chromosome is composed of several characteristics called genes. The all process has 5 main steps:

1- Initial population generation<br>
2- Fitness score evaluation<br>
3- Selection<br>
4- Crossover<br>
5- Mutation<br>

The fitness score evaluation, selection, crossover and mutation will be repeated until a stop condition. This condition can be a specific number of iterations (called generation) or a threshold reached (satisfying result).
