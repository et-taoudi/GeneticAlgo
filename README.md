## Genetic Algorithm Structure
A Genetic Algorithm is an evolutive process that maintains a population of chromosomes (potential solutions). Each chromosome is composed of several characteristics called genes. The all process has 5 main steps:

1- Initial population generation<br>
2- Fitness score evaluation
3- Selection
4- Crossover
5- Mutation
